     app.
  2. Improved Testing: Riverpod makes it easier to test your application logic in 
     isolation.
  3. Compile-time Safety: It provides better compile-time checks, reducing runtime 
     errors.
  4. Code Organization: Riverpod helps in organizing your business logic and state in a 
     clean, modular way.
